# vector-field-viz

Saw this on Instagram Reels and wanted to extend it for **differential operators, line/surface integrals (and divergence), field transforms, flows, and decompositions**.

## Premise
This project is an interactive visualizer for vector fields in 2D/3D.  
It lets you explore both **intuitive visuals** (arrows, streamlines, flows) and **hardcore math** (Helmholtz decomposition, flux integrals, spectral transforms).

## Goal
Make abstract vector calculus concepts **visual and interactive** â€” so you can see how fields behave, how divergence and curl "feel," how flux connects to divergence, and how decompositions reveal hidden structure in a field.

## Allowed operations
- **Basic Views:** arrows, normalized fields, magnitude heatmaps.
- **Differential Operators:** divergence (sources/sinks), curl (rotation), Laplacian, Jacobian eigenvalue analysis.
- **Integral Operations:** line integrals (work), flux through surfaces, circulation around loops.
- **Flow Dynamics:** particle advection, streamlines, phase portraits, stability manifolds.
- **Decompositions:** conservative vs solenoidal fields, Helmholtz decomposition.
- **Transforms:** field rotations, coordinate changes, Fourier/spectral decomposition.
